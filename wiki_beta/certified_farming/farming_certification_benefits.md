# Certified Farming 

Certfied farms tap into the full potential of the [proof-of-capacity](proof_of_capacity) reward potential as they offer more benefits to the ThreeFold Grid's users. By using certified 3Nodes, certified farms provide 25% more yields to farmers compared to DIY 3Nodes. 

## What is certified 3Node? 

A certified 3Node goes through a secure boot process to guarantee increased security on a heardware level before being delivered to the farmer. It comes with a locked BIOS making it impossible for the farmer to make changes to Zero-OS. 

When the BIOS get's locked, it gets configured to use [TPM2](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_raj.pdf), a security implementation on the motherboard that allows Zero-OS to store private keys with the security of dedicated trusted hardware. With the ThreeFold Grid 3.0 release, TPM features will be used to verify and validate trusted hardware via TFChain. 

> Note: Certified hardware can only be manufactured and distributed by approved hardware partners and distributors that follow the secure boot process defined by ThreeFold_Tech. 

## What are the benefits of certified farming?

Certified farming provies many benefits to the ThreeFold Grid ecosystem, including users and farmers themselves, as well as our planet.

Benefits for farmers include: 
- 25% more farming rewards for achieving higher service level agreements.
- Direct defect and certified build support for Zero-OS and it's primitives.
- Lower operational cost with a power management solution that puts the 3Node to sleep when not used. 
- High security of provides a better reputation on TFChain and the capacity explorer.
- Better reputation increases probability to unlock stakes farm tokens sooner. 
- Ability to implement custom networks based onn VxLAN and other networking technologies (needed for hybrid or private clusters)
- Access to a farming bot that makes it easier to manage a farm's power management, network settings, token rewards, and better protection.
- Possibility to integrate custom monitoring.
  
Benefits for users include: 
- More information about the farm such as connection capabilities, hardware quality and SLAs.
- Better uptimes are required by farmers as required by SLAs.
- Optimal security as defined by secure booting process.
- Legal protection in regards to compliance, privacy and security as required by SLAs.
- Guarantees in regards to the farm remaining operational as required by SLAs.
- Access to support inquiries via TFChain.

Benefit for our planet: 
- A power management solution allows better energy management on a farm level. 
- All certified 3Nodes are bound to take part in the carbon regenerative program of the ThreeFold Grid which involves in the purchase of carbon credits to finance climate action.
- Provides for an inclusive network of Internet capacity available to everyone, everywhere. 
- Offers important sovereignty benefits to users and countries.
