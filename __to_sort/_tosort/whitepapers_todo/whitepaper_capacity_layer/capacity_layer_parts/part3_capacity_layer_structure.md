Kosmos is ThreeFold's scripting environment (see [jumpscale](part5_jsx_empowered)) which allows you to deploy any workload in a very efficient, easy way. The Kosmos shell is very easy-to-use and can be installed on any platform.

Kosmos and the Kosmos Actors will create a low-level “workload definition” which gets registered on the blockchain database. After verification by humans and/or bots (multi-signature on the BCDB), the Zero-OS will pick-up the workload and do the local provisioning.
