## Peer-to-Peer

Decentralized as a word has centralized inside. The idea is not to make an organization or group of people the owner of a centralized system but rather the other way around â€“ any person or legal identity becomes the center of their own digital life, like in a peer-to-peer system.

Each person or legal entity (can be a trust, a company, or a government department) owns a 3Bot or Digital Twin. They interact with their 3Bot, and that 3Bot can interact with other 3Bots, without intermediaries.

3Bots are the actors inside the system. All user data is owned by 3Bots, which are themselves owned by people or legal entities. All 3Bots have to be registered in a digital phone book (implemented by means of blockchain technology). By being in that phonebook, all a 3Bot needs to find another 3Bot is the ID of that 3Bot.

Each entity (human or legal) can define multiple circles. These circles define how we interact with other 3Bots (access rights, etc).
