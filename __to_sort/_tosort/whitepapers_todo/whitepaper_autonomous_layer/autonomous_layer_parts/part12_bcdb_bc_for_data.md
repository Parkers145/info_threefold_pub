## The BlockChain DataBase (BCDB): a blockchain for storing data (dispersed) 


### 3Bot data: The 3Bot Directory 

3Bots are the active components of the autonomous layers. 3Bots represent individuals and other legal entities, and in order to operate they need to interact amongst different ones. The 3Bot blockchain provides the means for 3Bot to identify who they need to complete their operational task. The 3Bot blockchain acts as their phone book. Each 3Bot has an entry in this phonebook. The following information is stored specific to each 3Bot:



*   Unique global ID (is a nr)
*   Name (a name e.g. kristof.ibiza)
*   Address, which allows other 3Bots to find your 3Bot
*   Public Key, which is important to establish secure communication between 3Bots
*   Generic Usable Data Field

With this data stored in a way that is accessible to all each 3Bot has the means to find which other 3Bot he needs and where to contact this 3Bot to complete certain operational tasks
