quantum safe filesystem

4 separate use cases seperate wikis
- cloud
- digital twin
- quantum safe filesystem
- blockchain jukebox

Quantum safe storage
- base system - Ubuntu / Kubernetes cluster
- CLI tool
- provide TF wallet / DGB wallet (derived private key - specific wallet for the ) - interval to flush data to the backend (either default or configurable) 15 mins minimum
- auto provisioning (basic questions, region, policy, sizing (start, max) as a start)  TF Identity
- returns encoded metadata which is the.  config file is stored in the metadata store.
- you need to get a hashed version of the access data need to get to the metadatastore. (metadata store has all the information)
- store this hashed information safe to be able to recreate access / front end to get back to the storage solution
- metadatastore is stored in a quantum safe manner 
- to dispose data - throw it away - and many filesystems


- Create the wiki
- Create the test plan
- Bounties for testing effort by community 
- helm charts  for cluster deployment

- start TFT only
- for payment 
- quantum safe filsystem will create and deploy
- planetary network 



blockchain juke box

- allow people to deploy nodes
- interface is telegram (bot)
- ot will ask all needed information
- presents QR code - scan QR code and pay / sign for the required capacity
- centralised server to deploy
- TF connect to sign

deployment of blockchain
- football
- get QR code 
- QR code will open TF connect
- 10 people who are the originators
- permissioned blockchain only
- casper, parity substrate.
- human blockchain concept.
- smart contract for IT - executed.


Primitives
- cancel / stop
- extend time / add nodes
- updates (new version / software)
- major consensus to expell people
