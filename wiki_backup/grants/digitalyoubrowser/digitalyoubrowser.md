# DigitalTwin Browser

![](img/jimber_browser.jpg)

_The DigitalTwin Browser_ is a browser that runs close to your digital twin - Crystal_Twin. It presents you with the ability to have a browser on the ThreeFold_Grid running anywhere you want and to securely stream the content back to your local browser.

### Purpose

A lot of hacking happens in your current browser, but this won't be possible with a DigitalTwin browser. Millions of people are looking for a browser solution which is:

- neutral
- allows you to own all your data
- faster, simple to use
- cost-effective
- able to work everywhere
- has advanced features like real time collaboration

### Status Today

- We have a full blown first version active and ready to be launched
- We are now fundraising to make the next generations
