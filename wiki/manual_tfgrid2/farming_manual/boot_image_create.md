## Create a Bootable Image

At this point you should have created your farm and noted its ID. The next step is to generate a bootable image of Zero-OS to boot your nodes.

The bootstrap service: https://bootstrap.grid.tf is there for you to generate your Zero-OS images.
In the bootstrap wizard, enter your farm ID:

Choose you network:

- If you want to run your node on Mainnet, select `Production`.
- If you want to run your node on Testnet, select `Testing`.
- If you want to run your node on Devnet, select `Development`.

If you are not sure what to use, select Production.

Lastly, download the generated image. There are multiple formats of images available. Pick the one most appropriate for your setup (if you know what you are doing).

We going to explain here the EFI USB method. So please click the `USB Image` button on the `EFI USB` section

Once the image has been downloaded, get a free USB flash disk and prepare it as follows:

- Remove all existing partitions from the USB (optional)
- Execute: `dd if=/path/to/image of=/path/to/usb conv=sync` (eg: `dd if=uefimg-prod.img of=/dev/sdb1 conv=sync`)
- Plug out the USB drive when copying has ended.
