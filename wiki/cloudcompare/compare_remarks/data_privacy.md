# Data Safety & Privacy

Thanks to the ThreeFold qsss data is always private & secure.

Data is stored over multiple locations (not as copies).

You can define your own policy e.g. 16 from 20 backends servers are needed, which means a hacker would have to be on 16 locations at the same time before its possible to retreive the data.

The QSFS can be used as a primitive inside Zero-OS, underneith our Zero-VM or even inside Kubernets.

> Please be reminded that QSFS is a secondary filesystem, its not meant for high performance workloads.
