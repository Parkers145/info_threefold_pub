## ThreeFold Foundation

The ThreeFold Foundation is a not for profit organization which believes that we need a new Internet for humanity and for the planet. 

It promotes the growth and expansion of the ThreeFold_Grid along with the ThreeFold_Token (TFT).

Today, the Foundation operates from out of ThreeFold_Dubai.

### Legal Structure

ThreeFold Foundation is legally-speaking not organized as a foundation or even a non for profit, but we try to operate as one. This was too hard to organize in Dubai but eventually this company will be 100%-owned by a real Not For Profit Organization. 

We have two options:

- A new structure in Switzerland (CH)
- or, ThreeFold_VZW which exists in Belgium.
 
There will be a contract in place between current shareholders of ThreeFold_Dubai entities and ThreeFold_VZW that ThreeFold_VZW can at any point take over all shares for a nominal fee. This basically shows the community that there are no for-profit intentions to this organization and that all will be done to maintain that status (to be done April 2021).
