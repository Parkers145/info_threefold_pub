## Planned Purpose

- Help anyone to structure a Commodity_Token, also called Utility Token.
- TFT is a Commodity Token, it's used to sell and buy a commodity â€“ in our case, ThreeFold Grid IT Capacity.
- We are working with some customers to do the same for Coffee and other Commodities.

This looks like it is covered off by adding the license above. Confirming with Raj. For now, I'm pushing this forward and will adjust if Raj comes back to me with something different.
