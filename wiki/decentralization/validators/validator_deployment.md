# How can people Deploy

Starting Feb/March 2022


- Deployment: the easiest Process
    - Buy TFT (not so easy now, but this week BTC->TFT will go live)
    - Go to a weblet, fill in the location you want the validator to run.
    - Your private key will sign the deployment for you.
    - Your blockchain node will be deployed for you on TFGrid from out of your browser (decentralized)
    - The node will not register unless the min nr of TFT is in your account wallet you deploy with.
    - Now people can stake up to the maximum.
    - Only when more than voting min is achieved, participation will happen.
- The Technical Route
    - You install cosmos blockchain yourself on a computer of your choice.
    - You manually configure your validator account and send your tokens to your validator account.
