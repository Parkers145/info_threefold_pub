# Delegator 

## What is a delegator? 

Delegators are TFT holders who cannot, or do not want to, run a validator themselves. TFT holders can delegate TFT to a validator and obtain a part of their revenue in exchange.

Because delegators share revenue with their validators, they also share risks. If a validator misbehaves, each of their delegators are partially slashed in proportion to their delegated stakes. This penalty is one of the reasons why delegators must perform due diligence on validators before delegating. It is important for the delegators to spread their risks over multiple validators in order to provide another layer of protection. 

## Why delegators are important? 

Delegators play a critical role in the system as they are responsible for choosing the validators and monitor their validator's actions and participation in the DAO governance. 

## Revenue Distribution and Validator Commission 

If you are not the owner of the validator node, then the reward will be shared with the validator's owner. 10% of the revenue will be given to this individual. Owner is the original person or company who reserved the validator.

### How to delegators choose their validators? 

As stated earlier, delegators plays an important role in ensuring the smooth running of the DAO's governance. Delegators are free to choose validators according to their subjective criteria. Selection criteria includes: 
- **Amount of delegated TFT**: Total amount of TFT delegated to a validator. A high voting power indicates a high trust from the community to this validator. However, larger validators also decrease the decentralization of the network, so delegators are encouraged to consider delegating to smaller validators. 
- **Track record**: Delegators review the track record of the validators they are choosing to delegate their staking to. This track record includes past votes on proposals and historical average uptime. 
- **Community contributions**: It is important to also look at the work that validators have contributed to the community such as educational content, participation in the community channels, contributions to open source software, etc.
