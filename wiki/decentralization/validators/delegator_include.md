# Delegator 

## What is a delegator? 

People that cannot or do not want to operate validator nodes can still participate in the staking process as delegators. As a matter of fact, validators are not chosen based on their total stake, which is the sum of their self-delegated stake and of the stake that is delegated to them. This is an important property, as it makes delegators a safeguard against validators that misbehave. 

For instance, if a validator misbehaves, their delegators will move their TFT  away from them, thereby reducing their stake. The total stake will be explicitly available to the commmunity and this will create a chain reaction. 

Delegators share the reward of their validators, but also share the risks. If a validator misbehaves, each of their delegators are partially slashed in proportion to their delegated stakes. This penalty is one of the reasons why delegators must perform due diligence on validators before delegating. It is important for the delegators to spread their risks over multiple validators in order to provide another layer of protection. 

Please see Risk section below. 

## How to become a Delegator?

## Why delegators are important? 

Delegators play a critical role in the system as they are responsible for choosing the validators and monitor their validator's actions and participation in the DAO governance. 

## Revenue Distribution and Validator Commission 

If you are not the owner of the validator node, then the reward will be shared with the validator's owner. 10% of the revenue will be given to this individual. Owner is the original person or company who reserved the validator.

## Choosing the validator 

### Directives of delegators 

Being a delegator is not a passive task. Here are the main directives of a delegator: 
- **Perform careful due diligence on validators before delegating.** If a validator misbehaves, part of their total stake, which include the stake of their delegators  can be slashed. Delegators should therefore carefully select validators they think will behave correctly. 
- **Actively monitor their validator after having delegated.** Delegators should ensure that the validators they delegate to behave correctly, meaning that they have good uptime, do not double sign or get compromised and participate in governance.

>> Please add information regarding the situation if whether a delegator is not satisfied with its validator and wants to change? 

### What are the different states a validator can be in? 

>> Need information here. How to know if a validator misbehaved due to being offline for too long or not signing blocks? 

### How to delegators choose their validators? 

As stated earlier, delegators plays an important role in ensuring the smooth running of the DAO's governance. Delegators are free to choose validators according to their subjective criteria. Selection criteria includes: 
- **Amount of delegated TFT**: Total amount of TFT delegated to a validator. A high voting power indicates a high trust from the community to this validator. However, larger validators also decrease the decentralization of the network, so delegators are encouraged to consider delegating to smaller validators. 
- **Track record**: Delegators review the track record of the validators they are choosing to delegate their staking to. This track record includes past votes on proposals and historical average uptime. 
- **Community contributions**: It is important to also look at the work that validators have contributed to the community such as educational content, participation in the community channels, contributions to open source software, etc.

## Risks

Staking TFT is not free of risk. if a validator misbehaves a portion of their total stake can be slashed (i.e destroyed). This includes the stake of their delegators. 

One main slashing condition/situation: 
- **Double Signing**: If it is reported that a validator signed two different blocks with the same ID at the same level, this validator will get slashed. 

This is the reason why TFT holders should perform careful due diligence on validators before delegating. It is also important that delegators actively monitor the activity of their validators.
