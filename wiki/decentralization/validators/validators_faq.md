# Frequently Asked Questions For ThreeFold Validators

#### What are Validators?

A blockchain validator participates in **“consensus”** and **maintains** the record of **transactions**. Once transactions are verified. Validators are computers that maintain the blockchain's **integrity** by keeping a record of the whole transaction history, from the first block to the last. 

In **Proof-of-Stake** (PoS) systems like ThreeFold L0 and L2 validators are given rewards as long as they stake [ThreeFold Tokens](https://threefold.io/tft) (TFT) and correctly participate in the network. This mechanism helps secure the network by imposing the need to lock up TFT in order to participate in the consensus decisions.

#### Why are Validators important for ThreeFold?

Validators are an essential part of the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. They are essentially the moderators of the staking system and have the extremely important **responsibility** of authoring new blocks on the chain. To have the **most decentralized** system possible, ThreeFold needs a good number of validator nodes that can be elected. That’s the primary reason why we limited the amount of validators one person or entity can hold to 1.

This creates the greatest variety of staking options for the community and also **protects** the system by preventing the chain from being controlled by one very wealthy individual. When there are more people validating the blockchain, it significantly increases the barrier to being elected and allows for a **fairer ecosystem** to emerge.

#### Can anyone run a validator node?

Validator nodes can be run **by anyone** with hardware that meets the minimum requirements (4TB of  storage, 32GB of RAM and 4 logical cores). Once the blockchain is set up on the hardware, all the verifications and voting is done on a web portal, a **seamless** process accessible to anyone. However, it is **important to remember** that if a validator fails to uphold their responsibilities, a portion of their stake will be slashed (fined), as such an event would impact the resilience and security of the network. 

The **responsibility** of a validator (owner) can be summarized to:

* **Actively** participating in the governance of the network the validator protects
* Producing blocks (requires the node to be online **24/7** to sync with the latest blocks)
* Validator owners are expected to be **active members** of the community and must always be up-to-date with the current state of the ecosystem, so that they can easily adapt to any changes.

#### What are the rewards?

To justify the running costs of the node as well as to gather a suitable income from supporting the blockchain, validator nodes earn rewards, see [here for L2 validators](validator_l2_details) and [here for L0 validators](validator_l0_details).

#### What are the general requirements?

* Reliable electricity. Either the electricity is always on or the validator owner takes precautions to put his/her node in a data center or invests in a UPS.
* Bandwidth > 50Mbit/s continuous connection. The higher the bandwidth, the better the validator can participate in the network.
* A 24/7 connection.

#### What are the hardware requirements?

* 4TB of SSD Storage (good quality SSD)
* 32 GB of RAM
* 4 physical cores

#### How many validator nodes will there be?

The amount of validators depends on type of validator.
Only 100 for L2 = ThreeFold Hub, there will be max 100 L0 Validators per sidechain of TFGrid, but there are more sidechains.

#### What’s the difference between L2 and L0?

Our three layer blockchain approach provides for unlimited scale and security.

**Layer 2** is the top layer of our ThreeFold ecosystem, also called ThreeFold HUB. It’s a Cosmos-based blockchain that is secured by L2 validators. Learn more about Layer 2 validators and their functions [here]().

**Layer 0** is the foundational layer of our ThreeFold ecosystem, also called ThreeFold Operators. It’s a network of validator node operators that secure the operating system layer of the ThreeFold Grid. L

#### Can I run more than one validator node?

You can only have one validator node in each validator category. 


#### Does this mean you only really need 50 000 TFT to run a validator node?

... and the 50 000 TFT for activation on voting and rewards can be done afterwards, optionally?

Yes for 50k TFT you can reserve a validator node for L0 Chain securing the TF Executors.
Indeed an additional 50k which can come from anyone, whoever choses to stake will be enough to get rewards and voting power.

#### What happens if my validator is down for a while?

Questions:
- If validator is running on grid and the host cutoff the machine…how could we responsable for the uptime and lose stacking token?!
- How many token could we lose?

Answer:

- no you would not loose staked tokens, maybe there would be an impact on reward for the time you were off
- the technical implementation is not finished yet, we use Cosmos blockchain for this, we will check the more technical details, normally a node can be offline for quite a while before there are issues.

#### Could we run validator on our farming machine?

Yes you can, you can run validators wherever you want. You can deploy manually (using code) or through a weblet on a location of choice.

#### When will Verification of applications start?

Starting February 21, 2022

The Foundation will begin with verifying the applications:

* Submitted validator requests will be **vetted and checked** on an individual basis
* Submitted **wallets** will be checked on for the respective **minimum TFT** balance (for amount of TFT required see: [L2](validator_l2_details), [L0](validator_l0_details))
* Submitted individuals / companies will be asked if they have more than one **validator request**. This request will be recorded.

#### What are the next steps after the sign-up?

After successfully completing the validation process, validator owners will be asked for their preferred way to **deploy the validator**. There are two options:
  * On the ThreeFold Grid with a simple weblet.
  * On bare metal that is owned and managed by the validator owner.

*If you haven’t topped up your account, please do so now to meet the minimum amount of TFT required.*

**Once verified,** the new validated sign-ups will receive an instructional link to their verified emails to activate their validator.

If you have further questions, please let us know in the comments and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

We're looking forward to driving the expansion and decentralization of the ThreeFold Grid with all of you!
