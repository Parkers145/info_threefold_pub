There are 3 layers in our ThreeFold GRID DAO

- Layer 2 = ecosystem security layer
    - TFDAO and TFT lives here (this is our main chain)
    - only 1 blockchain with 100 validators, secures the multiple Layer 1 networks.
- Layer 1 = internet of blockchains layer
    - ultimate scale because of thousands or millions of blockchains
    - is like a sidechain for TFGrid
- Layer 0 = the IT capacity layer
    - cloud computing layer.
    - tfexecutors live on this layer, secured by L0 Validators 
    - provide compute, storage and network resources to L1 and L2.
