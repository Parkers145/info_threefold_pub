# Reservation Process for L2 and L0 Validator

- Forum post in the dedicated channel in our forum
- We require the following info
  - link to companies/people behind (need to be open)
  - the purpose why do they want to run a validator
  - Wallet address on stellar or on TFChain which we need to check to see the TFT
- TF Foundation will check 
  - That validators are really independent, max 1 per farmer or person/company
  - That there are enough TFT
  - That there is no malicious intent.
- In case of doubt, it will be discussed on the forum, if needed TF DAO can block (is just governance).
- The first 50 approved will be able to deploy in Feb (maybe March) 2022.
