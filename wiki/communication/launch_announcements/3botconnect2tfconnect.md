# November 17 & 18: 3Bot Connect is Now ThreeFold Connect

As mentioned in [a preview of our October update](launch_announcements), 3Bot Connect is now called ThreeFold Connect across devices.

Note: No action is required, although if you have ThreeFold Connect installed already, you may have to update the app before the name changes on your device.
