# April 1: Recapping January to March 2021

![](img/q12021recap.jpg)

The first three months of 2021 are officially in the books, so we wanted to take a minute to give you a quick update on what we have been up to and where we are today.

## The TF Grid technology made huge steps forward

Much of the first part of this year has been focused on bringing new, unique, and valuable cloud offerings to the Grid, and testing and refining the technology and user experience. *Many thanks to our testing community, which is now up to more than 150 people!*

The team has put in tremendous work to get the technology to where it is today. Some highlights of the progress since January:

- [TF Grid version 2.4](release_notes_2_4_0) and [2.5](release_notes_2_5_0) were released, with 2.6 soon on its way.
- The Edge Virtual DataCenter launched with a 100% Kubernetes-compatible container orchestration framework; soon, a back-up feature will allow users to migrate workloads between eVDCs.
- The easy-to-deploy, unlimited-scale [zstor filesystem (zstor)](threefold_filesystem) was released as a standalone product – independent from eVDC and the 3Bot SDK. *We're incredibly excited about zstor, and you'll be hearing more from us soon!*
- We added new [ThreeFold Marketplace](evdc_marketplace) solutions and improved the user experience there; also, all solutions now have ThreeFold Connect single sign on implemented.
- You can now deploy DigiByte & Presearch nodes in just a few clicks on top of the peer-to-peer ThreeFold Grid via the Marketplace; soon we will be working with these partners to announce to their communities and bring adoption!

## Our digital avatar called Digital Twin nears testing phase

[Digital Twin](https://mydigitaltwin.io) is an "ultimate" end user experience where you can access numerous applications while forever remaining fully secure and private!

- Digital Twin version 0.2.0 has been released for internal testing
- It includes Chat, Meet (Video Calls), and File Storage as the first features
- We are working on the next version 0.3.0, to be released later in April 2021
- Stay tuned to get involved as being one of the first testers of the next release!

*By the way, we have now for months been using the video conferencing feature of Digital Twin ourselves, it's super cool and very useful!*

## We made major improvements to our web presence

Have you seen the new [threefold.io](https://threefold.io)?

We've developed an entirely new (and evolving) web presence to make it easier for different audiences to find what they're looking for within the ThreeFold universe. Take a look for yourself!

## 3Node Pre-Order Batch 1 of 2021 has closed

The first batch of 3Node sales for 2021 has closed, with nodes heading to the USA, Italy, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Cyprus, Bulgaria, & others!

## So, what's next?

There's a lot in store!

Key partnerships (a big announcement coming next week), further updates to the TF Grid and peer-to-peer Cloud, the upcoming releases of Digital Twin...

We have also been working hard behind the scenes on a strategy to bring the ThreeFold Token to the next level through PR, marketing, partnerships, and more – which is now being activated!
