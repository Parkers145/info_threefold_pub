### No Anonymity

We believe that anonymity is not needed and not to the benefit of a project.

>TODO: link to forum about anonymity

### we do not support:

- no messages around other token projects 
- no messages to make publicity for exchanges
- no messages which have as intent to sell us something (e.g. exchange listing)
- no messages with as intent to harm our project or any other project or person
