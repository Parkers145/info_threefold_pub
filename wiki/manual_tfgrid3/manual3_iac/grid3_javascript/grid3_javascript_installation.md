The [client](https://github.com/threefoldtech/grid3_client_ts) is written using typescript to provide more convinient, type-checked code

## Installation
- Install node: [nvm](https://nvm.sh/) is the recommended way
- Install typescript `npm install typescript -g`

After the client is published on NPM it should be easier something like `npm install grid3_client`

After the installation you should check [Getting started on Threefold Grid](manual3_getstarted_home) to get up and running with the requirements like creating an account, creating a twin, getting the mnemonics, sending money.
