# The World Needs True Decentralization

![alt_text](img/theworld_.jpg)

# Introduction

Is Liberalism dead? Is there an alternative? The world has never been more global and prosperous, but so many people are unhappy. Our too capitalistic (rational mind driven) system is destroying our planet's resources and most people ignore this sad reality and go on with their lives like everything will stay the same as has been for the last 60 years.

The world needs some healing. There is too much talk in our world and not enough action. We believe that we are not powerless. We shouldn’t blame others: governments, society, politicians or other countries. We all are at the source of the problems the world is facing today, together we can do something about it.

We need a new approach, an approach which starts with ourselves and we need to realize that we can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them (Einstein).

We believe we need a new truly decentralized internet, an internet not owned by some large corporations but an internet where you become the center of your own circles. This internet needs to be owned by all of us together. The goal is to make everyone the center of their own universe (we call them circles). Not as a part of a big machine or, more recently, a blockchain.

We at ThreeFold are working to create such a decentralized internet. In this document you can read more about why do we need such a solution and the introduction of our 3Bot (which is your digital avatar) as the main instrument of this decentralization.

The document you’re reading now is focussed on the functions of the 3Bot (you’re digital self = avatar) and how we need to become the owner of our own data and the center of our digital life on this improved internet.

We are not a rebellious group. We are a growing group of people who don’t want to wait for things to change because together, we believe we can help the world to heal. We are a passionate group of people who act. We want to work with any government, financial institution, university or any organization to make this change as long as we agree on the same set of values. You can read more about our values in our [“FreeFlow Nation” manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q4R8LCF6oasrrJMe8hsu2yLjtAKYVseuLjpOyyMYEHg/edit).
