## The idea: we need an improved “IT” system where we become the center.

For the last couple of years blockchain was the synonym for decentralization. We believe this is not True, most blockchains are not decentralized at all. They are distributed systems but not decentralized.

Real de**central**ization is still centralized but in a different way. In our way of decentralization we believe that you need to become the center of your digital life and no-one but you can define how your data is being used.

We believe every legal or human entity should have a digital avatar = our digital self. This avatar is an application running in a neutral and free internet and is online all the time and can speak to any other digital avatar in all freedom and with all efficiency. More like how cells work in our body, all together we create a functioning digital world, by collaboration rather than suppression & control.

Above described system allows every person or legal entity to communicate to each other in all freedom. All 3Bots are registered in a sort of phone book (implemented by means of blockchain technology). This phonebook allows every 3Bot to find any other 3Bot. Each 3Bot has a unique id of only 1 number. Each piece of data in this digital universe is owned by a 3Bot (company or person), also this piece of data is identifiable by 1 number. **This means that any information in the world can be addressed by only 2 numbers**. A 3Bot has a very unique way how to use the storage energy as delivered by the 3nodes and can store unlimited amounts of information which can never be lost nor compromised. This is truly groundbreaking technology much more efficient compared to any existing blockchain technology.

It's hard to comprehend how much more efficient our digital life becomes because of this architecture. The global world's information available at your fingertips at full security and authenticity. All communication is full peer2peer no centralized systems are required.

The world needs an efficient **Decentralized Information Systemwhich we call the 3Bot.** ThreeFold has created technology which can be used to develop such a system running on top of the ThreeFold_Grid as described in previous chapter.
