Geert has 24 years of experience in IT of a Belgian financial institution, and is passionate about new technologies such as AI and blockchain. Project Coordination fell in love with Threefold With digitisation and blockchain, the world is changing. I believe that doing it the ThreeFold way, the world will change according to the true spirit of blockchain, enabling a real decentralisation and bringing more equality. Moreover, having internet capacity used as a real world value backing and a monetary instrument, ThreeFold can make the bridge between the cryptoworld and the ‘old’ world.
