We dream about a world where everyone can be happy, with respect for each other and the world's resources. A world where we dare to love ourselves and we don’t have to be scared about our future. A world where we don’t need to be a product and we have learned to collaborate with openness and trust.

We believe we are born as beautiful people, but fear leads us in a direction that might not be the path to happiness. In general, we believe that people want to do good. 

We believe the world needs to raise consciousness on 3 levels. 

- Physical = environment, food production, energy, ...
- Spiritual = personal growth in awareness 
- Digital = the system with the potential to connect us all
