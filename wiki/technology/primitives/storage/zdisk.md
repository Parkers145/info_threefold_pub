# ZDisk

Virtual disk creates the possibility to create and use virtual disks which can be attached to containers (and virtual machines).  

The technology is designed to be redundant without having to do anything.

## Roadmap

- The virtual disk technology is  available on development net only and is being bug and stress tested.  
- Based on demand presented by OEM partners or customers this feature will be planned for production / general usage.  At this point is time there are no plans for rolling this out.
