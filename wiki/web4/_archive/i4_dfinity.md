### DFINITY The Internet Computer

![](img/dfinity_internet_computer.jpg)

A massive distributed server with more capabilities. Is still blockchain based and has same issues as above, but is definitely a very advanced iteration.

Protocol driven security based on encryption and blockchain technology.

It still client server where we (the user) are part of a big machine.

#### Advantages

- New paradigm can be made very scalable & reliable
- Maybe (eventually) more easy than having to code all from scratch, more primitive constructs available.
- The language they use and how they get to redundancy is very cool.
- They have a lot of money, they should be able to create awareness.
- Their servers run as "canisters" in autonomous mode, giving a lot of power to the developer.

#### Disadvantages

- Slow, they are talking ms to get info, seconds for updating data. In a datacenter context this is very slow. DFinity has been designed to operate on internet scale but makes it slow for higher performance situations.
- Limited in features, it will take long time to change everything and cost massive amount of investment to get everyone to change their programming habits.
- No good storage paradigms, potentially needs other blockchain technologies to complement leading to performance loss and more complexity.
- Protocol driven architectures lead to less security, hackers have more visibility than a true peer2peer system with no blockchain.
- A huge big distributed machine, delivered by many commercial parties can lead to less than optimal decentralization.
