## REMARKS

So to make larger installations please consult with local network engineers and create the most simple and effective paths from the 3nodes to the internet.  We prefer connectivity (natively) through IPv6 to the service as this is the future proof networking technology to use but appreciate the affort of you to put forward IPv4 connectivity as half the worl still connects with that.

Redundacy, reliability and servie or application uptime are achieved in a very differnet way on the TF Grid than in tradition IT architectures. Therefore an effective conenction of 3nodes to the internet is achieved if the path to the 3nodes is simple and effective.  We do recognise that is yo want to farm at large scal eyou have to make some resilience and redundant setup but we do advise you to keep it simple.
