# ThreeFold Grid Capacity Explorer

![](img/grid_stats_.png)

Thousands of 3Nodes are connected to the ThreeFold Grid across the world. 

Find the live stats at https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics

The explorer receives its information via GraphQL straight from the [ThreeFold Blockchain](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold/#/tfchain). It allows you to explore all farms and 3Nodes using multiple filtering options.

- Full stats overview and grid map
- Farm ID, Name, & Certification Type
- Country of Location
- HRU, SRU, MRU, & CRU

**Features:**

- Switch between tabs: overall statistics, nodes, and farms
- In nodes and farms tabs, use the filters to better find what you are looking for
- By clicking on a node or a gateway, you get access to a full information view
- The information view lets you inspect a specific node or gateway in more details. Next to basic information (like farm, location, uptime), you can also find the primitives currently provisioned on the node and how much resource is available on the node or gateway.
