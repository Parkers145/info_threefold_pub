# ThreeFold Sales Channels

1. **direct** = every person in the world can buy capacity using our blockchain = TFChain <BR>with a [discount](staking_discount_levels) based on level of TFT in your wallet.
2. **indirect** = ThreeFold selected partners are rewarded additional rebates to compensate for the sales effort.

## Indirect

Because of how farming is being structured (starting TFGrid 3) there is upto 60% available of the cultivation fees to reward the sales channel. This means that the sales channel in multiple steps can be rewarded to create solutions on top of TFGrid and sell the capacity.

If partners buy the capacity for their own usecase they also receive the [discount](staking_discount_levels) based on level of staking.

### Example with software vendor

A software vendor (e.g. security camera software) builds a service on top of TF_Grid and gets serious discount for using the TFGrid.

### Example with telecom company

A telco will sell the cloud capacity to its business customers, the telco gets his margin out of this cultivation fee.

### Example with system integrator.

A system integrator wants to deploy IT cloud capacity close to their customers with more security.
To reward this system integrator for the sales effort and promotion activities part of the Cultivation Fee can be used.
