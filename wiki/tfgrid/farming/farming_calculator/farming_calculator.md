# Farming Reward Calculator

We have created a calculator to allow you to simulate the profitability of becoming a farmer. Different 3Nodes will produce different Storage Units (SU), Compute Units (CU), and Network Units (NU).

Try the farming reward calculator [here]](https://simulator.grid.tf) and find below examples and variations of farming rewards over the next 5 years as a guide. 

## Example

A [Titan v2.1](https://shop.threefold.tech/) costs about $1000
- The VAT varies according to regions
- Comes with the following capacity
    - 8 logical cores
    - 32 GB memory
    - 1000 GB SSD disk space
- Which converts into 7.75 CU & 2.67 SU
- It get 25% more farming rewards as it is a certified node
- Simulation Parameters
    - 0.06 USD as starting TFT price
    - 1 USD as 5Y TFT price
    - 0.15 power cost per KW/h
- Farming reward for CU & SU = 458 TFT per month (over 60 months)

Following the above example, a farmer would earn **28,250 TFT** representing **28,250 USD** if TFT would be valued at 1 USD. The hardware and powers costs over 5 years would be about 1000 USD and 302 USD respectively, resulting in a **Net Profit of 26,947 USD** and an ROI of **2068% ROI**. 

Considering the above specifications, buying a Titan v2.1 as at 17th November 2021 would produce an additional 12,725 TFT compared to buying TFT at the same date. 

> Disclaimer: This is a simulation only and shouldn't be considered as financial adivce. TFT is not an investment instrument as it is a utility token for Internet capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. 

### Variation 1

- Same Titan v2.1 but with Europe tax and Public IP Address
- Net Profit = 26940 USD, 10,500 TFT extra compared to straight TFT buy, ROI: 2034%

### Variation 2

- Same Titan v2.1 but with Europe tax with 5Y TFT price only 0.5
- Net Profit = 12413 USD, 9,775 TFT extra compared to straight TFT buy, ROI: 937%

### Variation 3

- A DIY node (not certified) with same specs as Titan v2.1 costs 950 EUR with 5Y TFT price of 1 USD
- Net Profit = 20767 USD, 6,147 TFT extra compared to straight TFT buy, ROI: 1712%

## Additional notes

- The [farming rewards](farming_reward) describes the TFT reward logic for a 3Node's Internet capacity.
- Farmer doesn't have to sell 
- Thanks to our sales model farmers don't have to sell their Internet  capacity as the [proof-of-utilization](proof_of_utilization) algorythm incentivizes threefold_channel.

## Potential factors impacting farming rewards

Like any technological or decentralized project prior to major growth, some questions may arise around potential alternate future scenarios. We cover these scenarios and explain why ThreeFold overcomes these possibilities. 

1. *What if ThreeFold's technology does not work?* As a matter of fact, the ThreeFold Grid has been live for +2 years. The Grid is self-driving and self-healing and is more resilient than any other Internet and cloud infrastructures. The whole global electricity grid would have to go down for ThreeFold's technology to stop working. 
2. *What if TFT doesn't appreciate in value?* Considering the growth of the global cloud market and the rising demand for decentralization, it is unlikely that TFT value won't appreciate with the token's scarcity model. Also, with rising utilization of the ThreeFold Grid, the ThreeFold_Council (or future ThreeFold DAO and validators) will be able to adjust the scarcity with higher burn rates applied on [proof-of-utilization](proof_of_utilization).
3. *What if digital currencies face legal and regulatory challenges?* While it is possible for the global crypto market to face regulatory and legal challenges in the future considering how most of the projects are designed, TFT holds a true utility in terms of Internet capacity backed up by hardware. So any form of currency, including fiat currencies could also be used to finance the farming operations.
