# Farming Reward Calculator

We have created a calculator to allow you to simulate your potential return on investment of becoming a Farmer. Different nodes will produce a different Storage Units (SU), Compute Units (CU), and Network Units (NU)

The [Farming Logic v3 document](farming_reward) describes how many TFT your node will receive. 

Thanks to our sales model you also do not have to sell the capacity of your server(s), as we leave incentive for our threefold_channel 's to run a business on top of it.

## Do your own calculation:

See Titan example (left in sidebar), for ready made solutions.

## Risks

- ThreeFold Technology is not working
  - _FACT: The technology is already working today_
- The ThreeFold token does not appreciate in value
  - _Unlikely: The cloud business by itself is growing and with increasing update of the TF Grid as an alternative to the large cloud vendors there will be token scarsity._
  - _The ThreeFold_Council can make changes the business model to create more scarsity (e.g. burn a higher percentage of the tokens)._
- Digital Currencies become illegal
  - _Unlikely: TFT has a utility - TFT represents  unit of compute and storage capacity._
  - _Even if this would happen despite all logic, then normal FIAT currencies can be used.  The token is only a effective means of value exchange._
