# Cost of Utilization of Capacity for a Famer their own farm.

We would like to make sure that a farmer can use most of their provided capacity super cost effective.
The ThreeFold Dao will take care of this situation.

The idea is that the farmer will pay

The tokens farmed for the capacity (means negate the already farmed tokens) + a certain TBD % e.g. 10% to pay for the technology used.

In other words will be very cheap for farmers to use their own capacity.

> TODO: needs to be further described as the DAO gets further defined.
