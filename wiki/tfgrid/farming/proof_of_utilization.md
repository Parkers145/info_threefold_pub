# Proof Of Utilization

TFT is an Utility token and gets generated by ThreeFold Farmers, see [Proof Of Capacity](proof_of_capacity).

Each TFGrid user can now use this capacity, the [TFChain](tfchain), will track the utilization of this capacity. We call this **Proof of Utilization**. Each hour the utilization is being tracked on the blockchain and charged to the user of the capacity.

How does the cost get calculated

- discount calculated in line amount of TFT you have in your account on TFChain. [More info about this discount](staking_discount_levels).
- TFT get charged from your account and distributed using table below.

| Percentage | Description                            | Remark                                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 35%        | needs to be burned                     | results in more TFT burned compared to generated once grid more mature.  |
| 10%        | to TF Foundation                       | used to promote the manage the project.                                  |
| 5%         | to Staking Pool for TFChain Validators | used to reward the people who run the TFChain 3.0 blockchain validators. |
| 50%        | for solution providers & sales channel | managed by [ThreeFold DAO](tfdao).                                       |



## ThreeFold DAO rules in Relation To Utilization

- Each solution provider and sales channel gets registered in TFChain and as such the distribution can be defined and calculated at charge time.
- For billing purposes, ThreeFold DAO will check if its for a known sales channel or solution provider, if yes then the billing smart contract code will know how to distribute the TFT's. If the channel of solution provider is not known, then the 50% will go to a DAO owned Community Grant Wallet.
- The Community Grant Wallet allows for grants to the ThreeFold Community, TFDAO consensus needs to be achieved.
- For certified farming, [ThreeFold Tech](threefold_tech0) can define the solution & sales channel parameters, these are channels as provided by ThreeFold Tech.
- Burning can be lowered to 25% if too many tokens would be burned, TFDAO consensus needs to be achieved.
- A farmers can use their own provided capacity at minimal cost, see [Own Farm Utilization](proof_of_utilization).


> Has to be confirmed by Wisdom Council. Will only be fully active starting TFGrid 3.1.
