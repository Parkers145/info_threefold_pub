# Proof Of Utilization

TFT is an Utility token and gets generated by ThreeFold Farmers, see [Proof Of Capacity](proof_of_capacity).

Each TFGrid user can now use this capacity, the [TFChain](tfchain), will track the utilization of this capacity. We call this **Proof of Utilization**. Each hour the utilization is being tracked on the blockchain and charged to the user of the capacity.

How does the cost get calculated

- discount calculated in line amount of TFT you have in your account on TFChain. [More info about this discount](staking_discount_levels).
- TFT get charged from your account and distributed using table below.

| Percentage | Description                            | Remark                                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 35%        | needs to be burned                     | results in more TFT burned compared to generated once grid more mature.  |
| 10%        | to TF Foundation                       | used to promote the manage the project.                                  |
| 5%         | to Staking Pool for TFChain Validators | used to reward the people who run the TFChain 3.0 blockchain validators. |
| 50%        | for solution providers & sales channel | managed by [ThreeFold DAO](tfdao).                                         |



## Dome ThreeFold DAO rules

- if a farmer uses his own capacity (at CU/SU level), the cost will be the farmed tokens for that capacity + 10% for ThreeFold Tech. In other words the farmer can use own capacity almost free of charge, only a 10% fee goes to the technology creator of Zero-OS.
- when a user uses capacity, a solutionprovider secret or saleschannel secret can be specified, this allows the TFDAO to decide how the TFT needs to be distributed in line to sales channel and solution providers
- each solution provider and sales channel gets registered in TFChain and as such the distribution can be defined and calculated at charge time.
- for default farming, the TFDAO needs to find consensus to arrange solution & sales channel parameters. If not specified then the part for the solution providers and/or sales channel goes in ThreeFold Owned Community Wallet.
- The community wallet allows for grants to the ThreeFold Community, TFDAO consensus needs to be achieved.
- For certified farming, [ThreeFold Tech](threefold_tech0) can define the solution & sales channel parameters. 
- Burning can be lowered to 25% if too many tokens would be burned, TFDAO consensus needs to be achieved.


> Has to be confirmed by Wisdom Council. Will only be fully active starting TFGrid 3.1.
