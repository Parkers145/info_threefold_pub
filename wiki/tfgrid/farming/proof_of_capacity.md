# Proof Of Capacity

TFT is an Utility token and gets generated by ThreeFold Farmers, we call this process farming.

![](img/circular_tft_.png)


- Each day (later even faster) Zero-OS together with TFChain (our blockchain) registers the capacity as being made available by the farmer.
- The blockchain will calculate the reward per farmer. **Calculation and modalities for farming rewards [can be found here](farming_reward).**
- The farmer wallet is registered in the TFChain and can be modified by the farmer.
- TBD time TFT are minted by the TFChain in accordance to the farming rewards and distributed to the farmer wallet.


| Percentage | Description    | Remark                           |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 100%       | goes to farmer | Allows for a pure Utility Token. |

## ThreeFold DAO rules in Relation To Proof of Capacity

- Rewards per CU/SU in TFT are registered in TFChain per 3Node at registration time. For certified nodes the CU/SU reward was specified at sales/promotion time, this process is managed by threefold_tech. All of this information is public and can be see by everone of the community per node and farmer.
- The rewards per CU/SU are fixed over time for 5 years.
- If SLA (Service Level Agreement) was not achieved for 3 consecutive months, then the node will have to re-register which means the CU/SU reward will be recalculated at that time and re-registered in TFChain for that node.
- Rewards for NU and IP Addresses are dynamic, the prices get revised on regular basis and DAO consensus needs to be achieved for that. The TFChain knows how the NU and IP Addresses were used and as such the reward can be calculated for the farmer. 
- All CU/SU rewards are staked untill 30% is used or 24 months since registration. 30% measures over 3 months.
- If a node achieves 30% for 3 months but month after is again lower, then staking will happen again.
- Certified node gets 25% more farming rewards.
- TFT pricing pegged to USD (pricing changes in line with TFT/USD rate)
- Minimal SLA's need to be achieved before the farming reward can be earned (uptime, bandwidth, latency, ...)

> Has to be confirmed by Wisdom Council. Will only be fully active starting TFGrid 3.1.

### Still to resolve

- How to deal with nodes where storage, compute capacity is added or removed.
- The way how we calculage CU needs to be improved, people can use old hardware and get too much rewards, we are looking for ways how to mitigate that.

## Proof of Fraud

- We are developing a way how to detect possible fraud in proof of capacity, more details will be provided Q1 next year.
- Without disclosing all details its based on TPM chip as well as dynamic generated code which executes random proof of capacity checks.
- If the proof of fraud code finds fraud e.g. trying to fake the Proof of Capacity 
  - Node gets put in disabled and fraud mode
  - This means farming stops, farmer will have to re-register.
  - The farmer reputation will go lower, so everyone can see that this was (or is) a bad actor.
  - If tokens in staking, the Tokens get locked permanently.

## Link To Proof Of Utilization.

Each TFGrid user can use the farmed capacity, the [TFChain](tfchain), will track the utilization of this capacity. We call this **Proof of Utilization**. See [Proof Of Utilization](proof_of_utilization).
