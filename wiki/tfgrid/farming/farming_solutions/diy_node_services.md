## DIY Node Services & Warrantees

All DIY 3Nodes sold by ThreeFold Tech come.

- Plug and Farm - All you need to provide is an ethernet cable, connect that between the modem and the node, and connect the node to a (stable) power source.
- 2 years carry-in warranty. Meaning the Node needs to be turned in or delivered to the ThreeFold Tech Offices in Belgium if it needs to be serviced.
