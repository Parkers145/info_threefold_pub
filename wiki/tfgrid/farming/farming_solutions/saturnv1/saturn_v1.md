TODO: @despiegk No idea how to calculate this for the Saturn.

#### Carbon Double Win

- each CU & SU is being offset (by means of carbon credits) with 1 TFT (starting June 2021)
- this totals to 595 TFT for 5Y (happens month per month)

### Utilization Tokens (Tokens received for usage of your capacity.)

As per ThreeFold's Tokenomics all farmers receive tokens for farming (putting and keeping capacity online), but they will also take a percentage of the utilization (usage of the capacity paid for by users). This percentages is between 10% and 50% depending on who sells the capacity. If the farmer sells his own capacity he will get the full 50%. If he decides to let someone else sell his capacity he will be get 10% of all utilization activity.
