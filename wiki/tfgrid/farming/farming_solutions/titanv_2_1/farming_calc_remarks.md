### remarks

- Once a node is registered the Cloud Unit reward for CU and SU are registered on the blockchain, your farming will be in line with those parameters till end of life.
- Farmed TFT gets staked (pooled) per 3Node (per server) and only unlock if +30% is used of capacity or max of 24 months.
- Minimal SLA's need to be achieved before the farming reward can be earned (uptime, bandwidth, latency, ...)
- If you delete your 3Node, the staked tokens will remain on your name and come available after 24 months since start.
- you can sell your own capacity, this will give you additional 40% utilization rewards (so 50% total), the rest is for marketing and burning.
- These are farming logic terms for 3.0
- Cost of rackspace of datacenter is not in this simulation
- When adding storage to it (e.g. external reliable Harddisk the return becomes better)
