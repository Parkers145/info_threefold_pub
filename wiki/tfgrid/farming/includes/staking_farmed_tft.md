### Staking of Farmed TFT for Compute and Storage

All the farmed TFT get staked per 3Node and are only released to the farmer once the 3Node achieves 30% utilization for at least 3 months or a node was up and running for 24 months. ThreeFold Certified farmers can apply for exceptions for specific cases e.g. unlocking new teritory or upgrading from Farming 2.0 to 3.0.
