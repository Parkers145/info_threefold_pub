!!!include:tfgrid_is_large

The ThreeFold Grid is made up of many servers called 3Nodes that are distributed around the world by independent people and organizations called ThreeFold Farmers (“Farmers”). 3Nodes runs a unique operating system called Zero-OS, a lightweight and ultra-efficient open-source operating system. Each user can then access the ThreeFold Grid with a Digital Self which is a virtual system administrator that executes the commands (reservation of capacity, sending messages, store files, build applications, etc.) directly on the operating system level via a Smart Contract for IT.
