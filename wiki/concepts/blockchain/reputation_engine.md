# Reputation Engine

Keeps track of the reputation of farmers & their 3nodes.
Uses the  monitor_engine to check uptime and other sla requirements.

This is used e.g. in the TFT Farming process (rewards of TFT to farmers).

Later the users of the TFGrid will be able to use this to define how good a farmer is.
