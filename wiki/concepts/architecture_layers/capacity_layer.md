## Capacity Layer

Much in the way the trees and plants in a forest communicate and share nutrients through underground channels, the capacity layer includes an expanding grid of intelligent connection.

Without storage and compute capacity, there would be no Internet. Think of the capacity layer as being the foundation of the Internet. Hardware and software components distributed around the world form the ThreeFold_Grid - peer-to-peer network of compute and storage capacity.

Any application which can run on Linux, can run on the ThreeFold_Grid but with more speed, cost-efficiency, privacy & security, sustainability, and more. Any individual or organization can utilize the ThreeFold_Grid's capacity for any current or future IT workload - such as Blockchain, IoT, 5G, AI and VR/AR, and benefit from improved performance.

The ThreeFold_Grid represents the most advanced and only true peer-to-peer network of capacity in the world.
