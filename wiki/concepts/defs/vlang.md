# Vlang

- See https://vlang.io/
- The main language as used for 
  - our digital_twin backend
  - TFGrid 3.0 SDK

We are sponsoring this language because we believe in its future and are working super close together with the core development team of VLANG.

## benefits

- You can learn the entire language by going through the documentation in an hour, and in most cases there's only one way to do something.
- C performance
- Compiles to native binaries without any dependencies: a simple web server is only 65 KB
- Usable for smart contract language
- Webassembly translation (work in progress)
