## Why?

### Country / Government


### Telco or Tower Company

Telecommunication is sector with a steeply increasing demand in terms of speed, storage and acceptable latency. New technologies such as AR/VR, IoT, smart cities, self-driving cars all have their own need for good and fast interconnectivity. 5G is meant to respond to this need but requires in itself a big amount of local compute and storage capacity, and has a need for cloud agility in updating the supporting software, while upholding the security level on all exchanged data to the highest standard.
