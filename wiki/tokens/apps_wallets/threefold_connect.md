# ThreeFold Connect

ThreeFold Connect is much more than your average wallet. It comes with a 100% private two-factor athentication process, access to ThreeFold conversations and the latest new and updates around our ecosystem.

### Create your account

- **Step 1:** Download ThreeFold Connect on [iOS]((https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3bot-login/id1459845885)) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin&hl=en_US).\
- **Step 2:** Create a 3Bot name and connect it to your email address.
- **Step 3:** A 24 word seed phrase will be generated to secure your wallet when signing up. `Example: internet library engineer network beautiful enough club language donut kid wind flower people sky water mountain bicycle untold friend boat pole cook dry`. The seed phrase is your only "key" to your wallet and digital assets and the ThreeFold team won't be able to assist you. Please store it securely offline.
