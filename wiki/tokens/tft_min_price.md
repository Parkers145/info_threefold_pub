## The min price for a TFT = $0.1

We believe that there is a minimal intrinsic value per TFT starting at $0.1. ThreeFold does everything it can to establish that minimal price.

This implies the following:
<!--- TODO: need a thorough review of this before publishing --->
- No capacity can be bought for a price less than $0.1 per TFT.
- All announcements on websites of farmers regarding pricing needs to be more than $0.1 per TFT.
- Any TFT bought/sold through ThreeFold Connect (wallet) will have a price greater than $0.1.
> Note: if there would be TFTs left on exchanges for a price lower than $0.1, the wallet will automatically buy more TFTs to get to same order value.
- ThreeFold will be adopting a real peer-to-peer decentralized exchange and the minimum price will be at $0.1, as well. 

It could be that on secondary markets or on some public exchanges the price is below $0.1. Consider it as a discount on buying IT capacity on the Threefold_Grid and make it beneficial for you. We believe this will only be a short time situation.
