## Creation of TFTs

TFTs are rewarded when new capacity (storage & compute) is added to the ThreeFold_Grid in the form of hardware. 

[Farmers](farming_intro) farm (mine) capacity for the ThreeFold Grid. A TF Farmer is ThreeFolds more sustainable equivalent of cryptocurrency miners.

The amount of TFTs that are created by farmers depends on three variables:

1. Compute Capacity (CPU)
2. Memory Capacity (RAM)
3. Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)

Learn more about the variables [here](farming_reward).

Tokens are burned as result of cultivation which leads to nr of tokens to be limited.
