# What is StellarTerm?

[StellarTerm](https://stellarterm.com/) is an open source client for the Stellar network that allows people to trade on the Stellar Decentralized Exchange. Users can send, receive, and trade assets on the Stellar network easily with StellarTerm. It's arguably the best and most simple experience we've found.

# How use StellarTerm

Since StellarTerm is an opensource UI on top of Stellar Decentralised Exchange, you can just login there using your existing Stellar wallet. No need to create a new one, although you may want to create a new account for security reasons. To create a new account, click **NEW ACCOUNT** in the top right corner or just click **LOGIN** there. Login is possible by connecting your wallet, or directly entering with your secret key (although this option is not recommended due to security risks).

If you already have TFT in your wallet, just click on the Trade button next to it on the balance screen that you will see right after login:

If you do not have TFT in your wallet yet, go to the Markets page and scroll to the very bottom, find "Custom Exchange Pair" dialog and fill in the Base Asset field: 

- Asset Code: TFT
- Issuer Account ID or federation: GBOVQKJYHXRR3DX6NOX2RRYFRCUMSADGDESTDNBDS6CDVLGVESRTAC47

Select USDC or XLM or any other asset as Counter Asset and click to pair.

When you are on a trade page, you can select any other Counter Asset.

And then you just pick the order or create a new one the same way as on any other exchange.
