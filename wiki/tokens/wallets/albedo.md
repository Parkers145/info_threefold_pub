## Activate TFT or other currency/tokens

Please keep in mind, that on the stellar network you need to have some amount of XLM to cover transaction fees and also for any new asset you want to keep in your wallet, you have to add a trustline to it (activate).
To add a trustline, go to the "Balance" section, and click "Add trustline" button.

## Liquidity Pools

Albedo allows to join [Stellar Dex Liquidity Pools](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/liquidity-pool/). 
By joining Liqudity pool, you engage your funds in helping community with liqudity and earn transaction fees whenever exchange is happening for the specific pair. 
To participate in the liquidity pool, you have to provide in equal proportions two assets from both side of the pair.
Click a button "Deposit liquidity to the pool" and then select amount of first or second asset you want to provide and click "Deposit".
