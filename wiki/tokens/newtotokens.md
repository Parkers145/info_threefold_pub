# ThreeFold_Token for Beginners

While this section of this wiki covers all the basics of ThreeFold_Token, we  understand that some may be new to tokens in general. So, here's a few details to help you better understand what exactly is TFT, a utility token and more.

### Is ThreeFold_Token a crypto currency?

A crypto currency is a currency living on a blockchain. TFT lives on the Stellar  blockchain, so it is indeed a crypto currency. However, there are many different types of cryptocurrencies. 

As of today, the world mostly uses fiat currencies in the form of bank notes, coins or electronic transfers. Any government-issued currency is fiat currency. That means the money supply and value is controlled by a central bank.

The functionality of a digital coin is just that: a means of payment. It has the same features as money; it’s a unit of account, store of value and medium of transfer. In essence crypto currencies are not that different from the physical coins that we keep in our pockets, just that they are digital, and not controlled by central banks. However, digital currencies come with many benefits over fiat currencies as they represent an ultra-secure mode of payment on a decentralized environment that is not controlled by any government or bank, making it a trustful currency. 

ThreeFold_Token is a utility token which has a wider functionality than a coin. Utility tokens do have value, but they cannot be considered money as straightforward as a coin. A utility token provides value to investors in different ways. They give users access to a future product or service.

ThreeFold_Token represents a unit of decentralized Internet capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. Since TFT got listed on it's first exchange platform in early 2020, investors were able to buy TFT and use it as a means of payment to reserve current or future Internet capacity and services on the ThreeFold Grid.

### Is TFT like Bitcoin?

TFT shares a lot of similarities and differences with Bitcoin (BTC):

Similarities:
- TFT is decentralizing the Internet in the same way BTC decentralized finance.
- While no central bank is needed in the BTC model, no centralzied cloud such as Google, Amazon or Facebook is needed in the TFT model.  
- Both networks allow transactions to happen peer-to-peer.

Differences:
- While BTC works on a proof-of-work algorythm, ThreeFold's proof-of-capacity builds on proof-of-stake which brings much more scaleability and efficiency to the model. 
- While BTC is a crypto currency, it can only be used as a value exchange. TFT is a utility token, so not only does it have a given value but it can be used as a medium of exchange for Internet capacity.

### What is the process for buying ThreeFold Tokens?

There are different ways to get TFT. Here's a guide of the different options to buy TFT starting with the  easiest platforms.

#### Wallets

Some wallets let you buy crypto with a debit/credit card, bank transfer or even Apple Pay. Geographical restrictions apply.

#### Public Exchanges

Exchanges are businesses that let you buy crypto using traditional currencies. They have custody over any TFT you buy until you send it to a wallet you control. 

When buying TFT on a centralized exchange you will first need to send fiat currencies to the exchange to buy digital currencies such as BTC to be traded with TFT and vice versa if you want to transfer the value of your TFT back to your bank account. 

Public exchanges usually require KYC procedures. Some of them such as Liquid Exchange also have a [quick exchange](tft_liquid_quick_exchange) option to buy crypto with a VISA card and without KYC until a certain limit. 

#### Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

Decentralized exchanges are open marketplaces for TFT and other tokens. They connect buyers and sellers directly.

Instead of using a trusted third party to safeguard funds in the transaction, they use code. The seller's TFT will only be transferred when payment is guaranteed. This type of code is known as a smart contract. More on smart contracts

This means there are fewer geographical restrictions than with centralized alternatives. If someone is selling what you want and accepting a payment method you can provide, you’re good to go. DEXs can let you buy TFT with other tokens, PayPal or even in-person cash deliveries.

You will need a wallet to use a DEX.

#### Through Farmers

You can also buy TFT from Farmers such as [Mazraa](mazraa), the ones that produce TFT by connecting capacity to the ThreeFold Grid. All you have to do is to get in touch with them and issue a request to buy TFT.
