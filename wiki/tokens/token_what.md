# What are ThreeFold_Tokens (TFT)?

The ThreeFold_Token is the currency of the peer-to-peer Internet - the ThreeFold Grid. It represents a unit of reservation of capacity (compute and/or storage) and is the official medium of exchange on the ThreeFold_Grid. 

## What can I do with a TFT?

Users, developers, and enterprises use TFT to reserve the capacity they need to create, use and share their data, IT workloads and applications on the network.

With TFT, you can use the following products and services that live on the ThreeFold_Grid:

- [ThreeFold P2P  Reserve and use cloud capacity.](https://cloud.threefold.io/)
- [Digital Twin: A unique digital ID that assures that only you own your data, and no one else. Access numerous applications in full security and privacy. See Digital Twin wiki.](https://info.mydigitaltwin.io)
- [ThreeFold P2P Marketplace: Find ready-to-deploy peer-to-peer applications](https://marketplace.threefold.io/)

## Where do TFTs come from?

When farmers connect 3Nodes to the [ThreeFold Grid](grid_intro), they farm (mine) and get rewarded with TFTs. Learn more about the farming/minting logic [here](farming_reward). While farmers keep on expanding the ThreeFold_Grid, the token economy is limited to 4 Billion tokens. This limit ensures stability of value and incentivization for all stakeholders.

> TFTs are created (minted) by the TF open-source minting software as a result of capacity being connected to the ThreeFold_Grid. 

This process is called **Farming**. [You can learn more about farming here](farming_intro).

## A circular token economy

A circular economy enables anyone to take part and to get rewarded for it: 
1. When Farmers connect 3Nodes and add capacity to the ThreeFold_Grid, they will create new TFT through the process of farming.  
2. Farmers can then exchange the farmed TFTs into other fiat or digital currencies on public exchanges. Also, this is where users can exchange fiat or digital currencies for TFTs.
3. Once they have TFTs in their wallets, users can reserve capacity on the Threefold_Grid and pay farmers directly. We call this process [cultivation](cultivation).

## Explore the analytics of TFT on Stellar 

For token enthousiasts, you can check the analytics of TFT since it moved to the Stellar Blockchain in March 2020 [here](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/TFT-GBOVQKJYHXRR3DX6NOX2RRYFRCUMSADGDESTDNBDS6CDVLGVESRTAC47-1?filter=orderbook).

> Please note that the ThreeFold Foundation's sole purpose is to ensure the expansion of the ThreeFold_Grid and its ecosystem according to its vision and values. To fund these activities, part of each TFT transaction for cultivation goes to the ThreeFold Foundation to finance the ThreeFold_Grid's expansion and side projects that are believed to bring a positive human or planet impact.
