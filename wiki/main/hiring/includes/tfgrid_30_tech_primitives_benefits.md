**What's unique about TFGrid?**

- Global P2P Cloud 
- Our users/farmers become part of the "be the internet" movement

The way how to use our TFGrid is like docker on steroids, everything docker/kubernetes does we will be able to do as well.

**Exciting benefits:**

- Smart Contract for IT capability.
- Integrated with a self healing unbreakable storage system: qsfs.
- Integrated with a Planetary Network.
- Driven by a high level super fast/efficient development language: Vlang (also developed in our community and sponsored by us).
- Meant to allow developers to create self healing apps.
