## Some memories from 2015+

At one point in time we had an office on the 74th floor of a building close to the Dubai International Airport. It was a cool spot with a great view, but we also realized the importance of being located closer to the ground. We only stayed there for just a little more than 1 year.

Our main office was and still is in Al Jadaf which is, interestingly enough, a boat shipyard. This is where a lot of the ideas and work has been done to make ThreeFold possible.

The tower on the left in the photo above is where our office was. The place behind (to the right) is called Al Jadaf. We decided to do something different compared to most. No office in a fancy office building. Instead we have our office next to the water in a very old shipyard. Very unique, and it much more cost effective as well. (-:

Still today there are more than 100 servers located there in our testlab, and the ThreeFold Foundation is run from there.

## Structure: Oct 2021

- ThreeFold Labs IT is  our operational HQ from where all Foundation activities are coordinated.
- ThreeFold Labs IT is mainly funded from TFTech at this point.
- ThreeFold Labs IT is based in Al Jadaf in Dubai onshore.

Adnan Fatayerji is the managing director, in the future the shares of ThreeFold Labs IT will be 100% owned by threefold_vzw, we are in the process.

ThreeFold DMCC is also operational and used for some token matters and sales of IT capacity (is a freezone in Dubai)
