# Wisdom Council

![](img/wisdom_council.jpg)

ThreeFold Foundation has adopted the Wisdom Council system as a resource model of harmonious decision making.

*Based upon ancient leadership practices and modern social science techniques as a way to consider all perspectives of the members in order to make decisions that are in the greatest interest of the mission and for the good of all.*

The Wisdom Council is composed of 9-12 members.

## Process

ThreeFold Foundation prepares all the decisions to be taken and information to be reviewed by the Wisdom Council.
2/3 majority of votes are required and no less than 6.

Meeting minutes will be available on the https://library.threefold.me system. The first wisdom council meeting is planned for Summer 2021 and amongst others a review will happen for farming rewards, pricing & discount table.

For now, we use https://circles.threefold.me/project/despiegk-threefold_wisdom_council/issues as tool, all votes are logged there and members need to effectively add their support on each vote.

Once our TFChain 3.0 is available as part of TFGrid 3.0, we will revise if another approach should be taken in how we vote.

## Wisdom Council has following veto rights:

- Approve TFT donations (grants) to ThreeFold related contribution projects or doing good projects.
- Agree on changes in protocol or required data on TFChain e.g. [farming reward](farming_reward), [pricing](pricing) or [discount](staking_discount_levels) table. We expect that somewhere in the future our DAO will take over some of these functions.
- Approval of new [sales channels](threefold_sales_channel). The sales channels are recorded in TFChain (starting 3.1).

Next to this ThreeFold can ask for further guidance:

- Approval of changes on knowledge base (wiki) whenever community or a ThreeFold organization requires this.


## Members

Wisdom Council Members are community leaders chosen by Founders Circle due to their honorable integrity and exemplary service related to The Mission. Structure and balance of Member Seats is based on one's personal role, strength, purpose, archetypes and other respectful characteristics.

We also call a Wisdom Council Member a ThreeFold Guardian.

## Remarks about Grants

ThreeFold Foundation receives through the blockchain a percentage of all Internet Capacity farmed and sold on the ThreeFold Grid. These proceeds are used to further develop the ThreeFold Movement and later to benefit planetary do-good projects.

Also a certain amount of TFT are available to use for the further development of the TFGrid.

The Wisdom Council members converge (online) to discuss and vote upon the distribution of funds from ThreeFold Foundation to pre-approved and/or pre-selected do-good projects and organizations.


## Remuneration

  - We realize our own reason to be a council member is to be at the service of our community and the planet.

  - We actively work on our *own* self-development (e.g. meditation, self-reflection, sessions with energy healers or spiritual coaches, etc.)
- We really believe the values as described on our [FreeFlow Nation](https://freeflownation.org/manifesto.html).
  - We know them, we understand them, we agree with them.
- We are not addicted to any substance (e.g. food, drugs)
  - We can make decisions without being influenced because of the desire for one of the above-mentioned topics.
- We are technical – we are able & willing to use digital currency wallets, GitHub (or alternative), markdown code, wiki texts, etc.
