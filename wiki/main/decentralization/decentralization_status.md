# Decentralization Status

We believe we are well under way to being a decentralized movement. ThreeFold has been designed to be decentralized – there are more than 100 independent active parties (ThreeFold Farmers) building the ThreeFold Grid today.

## Decentralized and available today

- ThreeFold_Token is already available on different blockchain ecosystems – Stellar, Binance Smartchain and we're looking to integrate with more ecosystems such as Cosmos, Ethereum or Solana.
- This provides for a secure and decentralized foundation for everyone. 
- ThreeFold_Token can be exchanged on Stellar DEX, Pancake Swap and other decentralized exchanges. See [here](how_to_buy).
- Independent farmers add Internet capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.
- All the Internet capacity is registered on TFChain and signed by the Farmer's 3Node.
- All the technology produced by ThreeFold is open source for everyone to see the progress, ask for feature requests, check/audit the code, etc on Github.
- There are many companies involved in the ecoystem, see [ThreeFold Companies](threefold_companies). 
- 3Nodes measure and verify the Internet capacity
- The uptime is measured by 3Nodes and registered in TFChain.
- Minting (creation of new ThreeFold_Token) is all done by means of code and validated by the TFGrid_Guardians for TFGrid 2.x, from 3.2 it should be function of the TFDAO.
- All the minting history is available on the blockchain as proof of capacity.
  - The hash is put in the transaction of the minting operation.
  - This means there is proof of every minting operation.
  - Also, [block0](genesis_block_pool_details) has been documented.
  - From TFGrid 3.x proof of capacity is registered in TFChain
- TF Foundation & TF Tech use a priority management tool to let everyone have input on priorities and manage work well (see [circles.threefold.me](https://circles.threefold.me)).

## New in TFGrid 3.x

- Multiple Money blockchain: Stellar, Parity Substrate, Binance Smartchain
- Money & consensus separated blockchain
- TF Grid data objects are stored on Parity/Substrate-based decentralized blockchain database (phonebook, tfdirectory)
- Every farmer works with TFChain to register farm.
- Every grid user works with TFChain to register identity (uses TFConnect as tool).
- All billing is done through TFChain.
- All farming rewards are calculated through TFChain (starting 3.1)
- All governance is done through TFChain (starting 3.2)
