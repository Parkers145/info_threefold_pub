# ThreeFold Decentralization

At ThreeFold, we believe that decentralization is needed across a wide array of systems – including organizations – to build a better tomorrow. Decentralization typically brings more resilience, equality, and fairness. As such, we apply this in a variety of ways across our own structures and practices. Throughout this section, you will learn to understand exactly how.
